      <description>In 2019 I had the opportunity to share some of my research at the American Academy of Neurologists in Philadelphia. Here I’ll provide my poster as well as a few reasons for my excitement about the topic of literature bias in Alzheimer’s Disease.
What This Research Contributes:The largest review of Alzheimer’s literature focusing on biasExpands on previous Funding bias research in Alzheimer’s DiseaseProvides non-anecdotal exploration into Publishing Journal as a source of biasIntroduces Author Affiliations as a potential biasing factorBackgroundThe concept of literature bias is not new.</description>

      <description>In the pursuit of more data-centric medical decisions, large scale literature reviews are increasingly necessary. However, these literature reviews are far from entertaining and often hard to depict outside of a numeric tables. In this post, I’ll be visualizing hundreds of clinical trials in a single graph to show how it may be possible to use parallel plots as a copmlementary reporting tool for literature reviews.
This idea was insipred by an excellent set of plots from 538.</description>

In 2019 I had the opportunity to share some of my research at the American Academy of Neurologists in Philadelphia. Here I'll provide my poster as well as a few reasons for my excitement about the topic of literature bias in Alzheimer's Disease.

## What This Research Contributes:

* The largest review of Alzheimer's literature focusing on bias
* Expands on previous Funding bias research in Alzheimer's Disease
* Provides non-anecdotal exploration into Publishing Journal as a source of bias
* Introduces Author Affiliations as a potential biasing factor

## Background
In clinical research, the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is considered the gold standard due to it's ability to mitigate the amount of bias introduced by investigators and patients. The types of biases that RCTs counter are, however, only internal factors within the trial. What if there are external factors creating an unfair environment for the study to take place in? A common example of an external factor is Pharmaceutically funded research: Pharmaceutical companies are heavily invested in the success of their drugs and, as such, one might assume that trials run or sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are pressured to portray their products favorably. 

The three types of external factors I was able to investigate here are:

* Funding Bias
* Publishing Journal Bias
* Author Affiliation Bias

#### Funding Bias
Funding Bias is the idea that a study's sponsor can assert their influence on the final results of the clinical trial. The mechanisms in which this bias can be introduced has been described by previous authors and may include:
* Sponsors preventing the publication of research given unfavorable results
* Sponsors delaying the publication of research or forcing publication into lesser known journals to hide unfavorable results
* Sponsors only conducting a published clinical trial after many internal reports to ensure desired results 


#### Journal Bias
Journal bias is similar to funding bias in the sense that the publishing journals are incentivized to publish research that will attract people to their journal. Null and negative results may be rejected from publication in top journals despite being accurate portrayals of treatment efficacy in a phenomenon called "Positive Publication Bias". Journals also vary in quality of published research, for example: not every journal is peer reviewed and some will publish studies with substandard blinding and randomization. 

#### Author Affiliations
I was unable to find any previous research studying the potential effects of author affiliation on reported outcomes. This was a surprise as I suspect that affiliations have the ability to influence the authors just as much as a funding source would. 



## AAN2019 Presentation
This poster should help identify correlations between potential external biasing factors and the reported trial results.

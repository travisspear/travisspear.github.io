In 2019 I had the opportunity to share some of my research at the American Academy of Neurologists in Philadelphia. Here I'll provide my poster as well as a few reasons for my excitement about the topic of literature bias in Alzheimer's Disease.

## What This Research Contributes:

* The largest review of Alzheimer's literature focusing on bias
* Expands on previous Funding bias research in Alzheimer's Disease
* Provides non-anecdotal exploration into Publishing Journal as a source of bias
* Introduces Author Affiliations as a potential biasing factor

## Background
The concept of literature bias is not new. However, most research on this topic studies internal factors such as biased groups, randomization, or unfair treatment comparisons. I wanted to investigate the impact that external factors could have on reported results. The final set of external factors were found in the metadata of studies and included **Funding Source**, **Author Affiliations**, and **Publishing Journal**. 

#### Funding Bias
Of these three factors, Funding bias has been investigated the most with a few dozen studies over the past decade looking into it in a variety of disease areas. Results of these studies are mixed and still very sparse in Alzheimer's Disease. In the past, I have been cuationed against trusting pharmaceutically sponsored research due to the amount of money invested in the success of drugs - this makes sense, anecdotally, but I had never seen any evidence to prove it.

#### Journal Bias
Journals can introduce bias in two major ways: 

1. Only publishing "flashy" articles that show how great treatments are. (Who wants to read another null or negative result?)
2. Predatory journals publishing studies without a peer-review process or other quality control.

Given that I wanted to have large sample sizes for each subgroup, I was unable to study predatory journals here and focused on reputable journals that commonly publish Alzheimer's research.

#### Author Affiliations
I was unable to find any previous research studying the potential effects of author affiliation on reported outcomes. This was a surprise as I suspsect that affiiliations and study sponsors impart pressure on the authors to succeed in their trials.

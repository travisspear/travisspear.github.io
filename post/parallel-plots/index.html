<p>In the pursuit of more data-centric medical decisions large scale literature reviews are increasingly necessary, however, results of these literature reviews are often hard to depict outside of numeric tables. I’ll be exploring the use of parallel plots as a complementary reporting tool for literature reviews through their ability to display hundreds of clinical trials on a single graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This idea was inspired by an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-electoral-map-is-changing/">excellent set of plots from 538</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="the-final-product" class="section level1">
<h1>The Final Product</h1>
<p>Working at MedAware Systems, I had access to a massive dataset of Alzheimer’s research with variables already extracted. The following plot contains ~750 clinical trials sharing one common feature: the usage of a cognitive test called the “Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)” which is the most commonly reported measurement in this disease area.
In the plots below, there are many different elements and colors used to convey a variety of information about the state of each individual trial. To help orient yourself, the following list of items are the key features to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each faint line represents an individual <strong>group</strong> within a clinical trial<br />
</li>
<li>Trial lines are colored based on patients’ <strong>baseline cognitive score</strong> as defined by the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) cutoffs. (Higher Score is better)</li>
<li>The darker lines show the <strong>mean</strong> for each baseline disease severity group<br />
</li>
<li>Graphs are split by Active and Control treatments</li>
<li>The graph follows each trial across arbitrary times</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/noisyParallels.svg" /><!-- --></p>
<div id="what-does-this-graph-tell-us" class="section level3">
<h3>What Does This Graph Tell Us?</h3>
<p>Prior to running statistical tests, this graph demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most patients entering the trial with mild impairment according to the MMSE remained within the mild impairment boundaries</li>
<li>Both the Severe Impairment and No Impairment patients trended towards Mild Impairment by the end of their trials</li>
<li>Active treatments, seen on the left graph, appear to prevent the decline of Mildly Impaired patients when compared to control treatments</li>
</ul>
<p>These three observations would need to be confirmed but this type of graph makes it easy to formulate hypotheses.</p>
